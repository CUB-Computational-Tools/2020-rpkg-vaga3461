# R directory

This directory contains all the function files of the package. The names of the files do not matter but it is advisable to group related functions into informatively named `.R` files for easier code management.

## `package.R` file

This kind of file (again, the name doesn't matter) is a useful one to have for package wide documentation that is not tied to any particular function.
